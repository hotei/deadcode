## OVERVIEW

A fork of deadcode.go by Remy Oudompheng.  It's still useful even though there
are a few broken bits now that go has evolved to 1.4.2 (at time of writing).
See the godoc portion below for a list of changes I made to code.

### Installation

If you have a working go installation on a Unix-like OS:

> ```go get github.com/hotei/deadcode```

That will copy github.com/hotei/deadcode to the first entry of your $GOPATH

or if go is not installed yet :

> ```cd DestinationDirectory```

> ```git clone https://github.com/hotei/deadcode.git```

### Features
* simple
* works as intended
* friendly to markdown (new feature)
* works well in Makefile  (new feature)

### Limitations

* deadcode will ignore build tags that might be present in the programs being checked
	* [ed. Hotei] in time I hope to correct this but it's not urgent

### Usage

```
cd to the directory of the program you wish to check and run it

$ cd progDir
$ deadcode

or

$ deadcode someDirectory
```

deadcode.go (c) David Rook - original version (c) Remy Oudompheng

Changed the way program produces output so it goes to stdout vs stderr.

Changed exit code so it only produces an error code if program fails, not
just because it found dead code.

These changes make it much more friendly when used in a makefile to create
package/program documentation.

Added -md option to format output to be friendly to markdown parsers.
Added -verbose option to get an idea of what's being scanned

Use -make=false if you want the original behavior
